# EDS_Challenge


For this challenge I worked with H1B visa application data for 2014 from https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/docs/py2014q4/H-1B_FY14_Q4.xlsx s.


Section 3: Exploration (1/2)

There are several questions that could be answered in Section 3. 

For example:

1. H1B visa statuses;
2. Top H1B Jobs in the U.S. vs NYC;
3. H1B Visa cases by State;
4. Decision time frame for H1B. 

It was interesting to notice that in second question top five jobs in NYC are different than top five jobs in all cities. To answer this qeustion I used 2 data frames. First one, is the original data set that consists of all data for all cities in the U.S. and second data set that have the same data, but only for NYC. 

Results for all cities shows:

PROGRAMMER ANALYST | 43114
SOFTWARE ENGINEER | 20500
COMPUTER PROGRAMMER | 14950
SYSTEMS ANALYST | 10196
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER | 7337

and Results for NYC:

ASSOCIATE | 977
ANALYST | 875
SOFTWARE ENGINEER | 530
VICE PRESIDENT | 377
PROGRAMMER ANALYST | 374

I presume that these resuts could occur because NYC is attracting more specialists in Business and Finance industries.
